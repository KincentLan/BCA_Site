    <h1>What I've Accomplished in HackBCA III</h1>
    <h2>I learned some Ruby off the Rails which is an interpretive language.
    Much like Python. I also learned a lot about CSS in the making of this site.
    I liked making this site and I am here presenting today! Click the picture to a video I made in
    HackBCA III. </h2>

    <h2>RICK ROLLED!!!!!! Sorry about that, I had to. Overall, I had a lot of fun. I learned some CSS and HTML which I am proud of. I learned some Ruby as well.

    be a part of it again.</h2>
